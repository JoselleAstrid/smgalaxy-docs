# smgalaxy-docs
Various information on the inner workings of the Super Mario Galaxy games.

There is currently only one section:

* [SMG1 memory addresses](addresses/smg1/index.md)

This repository is meant to gradually replace my various Google documents on the SMG games. I think it should be easier to find my research info in one repository with proper links, rather than in 10+ Google docs.

This is not meant as a replacement for the Galaxy pages in the Speed Demos Archive knowledge base wiki ([SMG1](https://kb.speeddemosarchive.com/Super_Mario_Galaxy), [SMG2](https://kb.speeddemosarchive.com/Super_Mario_Galaxy_2)). GitHub makes it easier for me to update info on a regular basis, but online wikis generally make it easier for everyone to collaborate. So I'm envisioning using this repository for more detailed research info, while the knowledge base can be used for less technical info and summarizing technical stuff into practical terms.

Although this repository mostly contains stuff that I've researched, other Galaxy players have also made great contributions to some of these topics, so I'll do my best to give due credit when talking about those topics.

This repository and its author(s) are not affiliated with Nintendo or the game's creators.
